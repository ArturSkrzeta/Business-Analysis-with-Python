<h2>Business Analysis with Python</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Doing Business Analysis with Python ensures analysis process separation from the data and numbers being calculated.</li>
  <li>In Python, it's much simpler to follow the analysis logic (line by line - from top to bottom - from left to right) as opposed to excel where we keep hidden formulas within cells put all over the worksheet.</li>
  <li>Not only wokring within an execl worksheet, it's hard to follow the logic byt it's hard to find some bugs or to enter some modifications. In python debugging is very easy.</li>
  <li>It's getting even worse, once you get such worksheet from a team colleague who leaves.</li>
  <li>Keeping formating in the worksheet poses a risk of breaking the data readability and impacting on the final analysis.</li>
  <li>From my experience there were always problems with keeping proper data types for dates, numbers, currencies and strings for data being stored in excel worksheet</li>
  <li>Excel has no standardized way of handling a missing data.</li>
  <li>Excel is slow porcessing a large data set unless you use Power Query which may be a remedy</li>
</ul>
