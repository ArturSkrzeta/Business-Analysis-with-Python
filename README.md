<h2>Business Analysis with Python</h2>
<h3>Here are my couple of whys on the fact I tend to transfer my analysis from Excel to Python:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Doing Business Analysis with Python ensures analysis process separation from the data and numbers being calculated.</li>
  <li>Having the kind of separation we reduce a risk of making error or breaking dataset like f.e. in excel worksheet, shifting columns, inserting an empty row in the middle, dragging the formula too far and so on.</li>
  <li>In Python, it's much simpler to follow the analysis logic (line by line - from top to bottom - from left to right) as opposed to excel where we keep hidden formulas within cells put all over the worksheet - or what wore in different sheets.</li>
  <li>Straightforward line-by-line logic in Python ensures easy reporducibility of the analysis for different datasets.</li>
  <li>Not only wokring within an excel worksheet it's hard to follow the logic byt it's really hard to find some bugs or to enter some modifications. In python debugging is very easy and any modifications can be done by modifiing a line of code.</li>
  <li>It's getting even worse, once you get such worksheet from a team colleague who leaves and you don't even know where to start learning the logic of analysis.</li>
  <li>In Pytyhon I can insert some comments to a specific segment of a logic to help someone else to understand it quicker and better.</li>
  <li>Keeping formating in the worksheet poses a risk of breaking the data readability and impacting on the final analysis.</li>
  <li>From my experience there were always problems with keeping proper data types for dates, numbers, currencies and strings for data being stored in excel worksheet. That has massive impact on the data qualtiy.</li>
  <li>Excel has no standardized way of handling a missing data.</li>
  <li>Excel is slow porcessing a large data set unless you use Power Query which may be a remedy.</li>
  <li>From my perspective, it looks like Python is a perfect tool to resolve all mentioned excel problems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>After a quick prolog of hating excel here is the intro to my project case</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In Jupyter Notebook, I perfom short business analysis of sales dataset.</li>
  <li>For each segment of the analysis, I try my best to make business insighst on where to start looking for improvements in sales.</li>
<ul>
