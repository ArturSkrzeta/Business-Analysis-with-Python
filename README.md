<h2>Business Analysis with Python</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Doing Business Analysis with Python ensures process separation from the data and numbers being calculated.</li>
  <li>In Python, it's much simpler to follow the analysis logic as opposed to excel where we keep hidden formulas within cells.</li>
  <li>Not only wokring within an execl worksheet, it's hard to follow the logic byt it's hard to find some bugs or to enter some modifications.</li>
  <li>It's getting even worse, once you get such worksheet from a team colleague who leaves.</li>
  <li>Keeping formating in the worksheet poses a risk of breaking the data readability and impacting on the final analysis.</li>
  <li>From my experience there were always problems with keeping proper data types for dates, numbers, currencies and strings for data being stored in excel worksheet</li>
</ul>
